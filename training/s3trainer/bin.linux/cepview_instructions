The cepview executable allows you to view the
mfcc feature files that you generate before training and decoding in ascii format.

Usually the MFCCs in the first column are positive numbers and range from 1 to 20. If the 
numbers in the file are much bigger, or if you see the sequence "NaN" in the ascii
output, it indicates that there is some problem with your audio data. This is
just for your information and should not be a concern in this lab.
